# Quiltulator
***This web app was built in less than 4 days during my time as a student at a bootcamp. There are many things I plan to upgrade and new things I wish to implement now that I know much more, the looks of this one are pretty rough, I focused most of my efforts on the functionality*** 
An app that allows clients to build quilting patterns out of geometric shapes that they define. 
The end feature that is meant to provide the amount of each fabric in yardage is not finshed as the calculations required much more complicated than initial thought.
